Rainz Weather is a hyperlocal weather forecasting application designed to provide highly accurate and reliable weather information for any location. Rainz combines data from multiple leading meteorological models, including ECMWF, GFS, Met.no, WeatherAPI.com, Tomorrow.io, Open-Meteo, and other trusted global weather sources to deliver precise weather predictions. Rainz Weather ensures that users receive real-time, minute-by-minute updates for precipitation, temperature, wind, and atmospheric conditions.

Rainz offers multi-model ensemble forecasts, combining information from several meteorological models to increase accuracy. Ensemble forecasts provide a consensus view of expected weather, reducing errors from individual model predictions. Users can rely on Rainz for short-term, medium-term, and long-range forecasts, from hourly updates to 10-day and 14-day extended outlooks.

All users can access detailed hourly forecasts, daily forecasts, and interactive rain radar maps. Rainz displays temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, dew point, UV index, atmospheric pressure, visibility, precipitation chance, and other weather metrics. Seasonal indices, including pollen levels, snow accumulation, and air quality readings, are integrated for health and outdoor activity planning. Rainz provides sunrise and sunset times, moon phases, and other astronomical data for complete situational awareness.

Rainz Weather includes real-time alerts and warnings for severe weather conditions, such as storms, heavy rainfall, snow, freezing temperatures, heatwaves, and extreme wind. Notifications are designed to keep users safe, informed, and prepared for changes in weather conditions. Winter weather alerts, frost warnings, and heat index advisories are provided based on hyperlocal location data.

The app allows users to save multiple locations, enabling quick access to forecasts for home, work, travel destinations, or favorite outdoor spots. Each location can be customised with personal alerts, display preferences, and notification settings. Users can compare forecasts between locations and plan activities accordingly.

Rainz includes community-driven features, such as weather predictions, leaderboards, and social competitions. Users can participate in daily weather prediction games by forecasting tomorrow’s high temperature, low temperature, and general weather condition. Accuracy points are awarded for correct predictions: +300 points for all correct, +200 for two correct, +100 for one correct, +25 for maintaining streaks, and -100 for all incorrect predictions. Prediction streaks encourage consistent engagement and improve forecasting skills over time.

Prediction Battles allow users to challenge friends or other Rainz users. Battles are location-specific and expire at midnight on the day they are created. Both participants predict the same metrics for the selected location. Winners earn bonus points and leaderboard recognition. Battles add a gamified competitive element to the Rainz experience, making weather forecasting social, interactive, and engaging.
